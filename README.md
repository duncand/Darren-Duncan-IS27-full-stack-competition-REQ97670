# Province of British Columbia - Staff Directory (BCSD)

This document describes BCSD, a simple web-based database application that
implements a staff directory for an organization, where employees are
arranged in a hierarchy; it supports listing, viewing, adding, editing, and
removing employee records.

BCSD is implemented as a pair of applications named BCSD-DBMS and
BCSD-WEBAPP, such that the latter is what end users typically interact
with directly using a generic web browser, and the former is a supporting
service providing a RESTful API that the latter consumes.

## Quick Links

The canonical home of this BCSD source code is
<https://github.com/duncand/Darren-Duncan-IS27-full-stack-competition-REQ97670>.

A temporary live deployment of BCSD is on Heroku.

Visit <http://req97670-bcsd-webapp.herokuapp.com> in a web browser to
actually use the application as a regular end user.

Visit <http://req97670-bcsd-dbms.herokuapp.com/api/api-docs> to view the
interactive REST API documentation which lets you invoke the API directly.

## Contents

This document consists of multiple parts:

1. BCSD - Overview (the current part)
1. [BCSD - End User Manual](docs/Manual.md)
1. [BCSD - Structure](docs/Structure.md)
1. [BCSD - Local Deployment](docs/Local.md)
1. [BCSD - Heroku Deployment](docs/Heroku.md)
1. [BCSD - Future Functionality](docs/Future.md)
1. [BCSD - Assumptions](docs/Assumptions.md)

The [BCSD - End User Manual](docs/Manual.md) part is what regular end
users, who are simply using an already deployed instance of BCSD, need to
know; the other documentation parts are mainly for someone wanting to
deploy or develop the application or otherwise learn more about how it
works internally.
